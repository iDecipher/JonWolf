                    <p id="details">In case you're unfamiliar, Counter-Strike is an entirely multiplayer experience. You can play offline against AI bots, but these are still merely simulating what it's like to play online, rather than really giving you a single-player game. The good news is that this is as good as online team-based shooters get. In the traditional game mode, there are two types of matches and two tiers of play. Casual level is for newer players and removes aspects like friendly fire and the need to purchase armor and ancillary items each round (more on that in a second). Ranked level is the original style of CS, with all the "realism" settings enabled, but it also features a comprehensive skill-based ranking system to try to balance teams and place good players with other good players.<br><br> Both of these tiers feature several maps--original CS maps like de_dust are reproduced here and still going strong, mixed in with entirely new maps--and each map is tied to one of two game types. In Defusal, one team (the Terrorists) must plant a bomb at a critical site and defend it until it explodes, while the other team (the Counter-Terrorists) must try to either prevent them from planting it or defuse it before it goes off. </p>

                    <h2 id="review-title">Overview - DotA 2</h2>
                    <p id="details">Valve's artists deserve praise for a crisp and readable style that, after some practice, makes it possible to tell what's going on even in a massive brawl where both teams of five colorful fantasy characters collide and cast spells at once. However, credit for the intimidatingly complex design of Dota 2 belongs to the original Defense of the Ancients mod (known as DOTA) for Warcraft III, which kicked off the MOBA genre. Valve (after hiring on DOTA's key developers) has copied that formula almost to the letter, and as a result Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty – and that’s totally justified. It’s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class competitive game at the highest levels.<br><br>To grasp the subtleties of how heroes interact and fight you have to do more homework on the different kinds of damage and how they’re mitigated; how to prevent one type of spell from affecting you, and when you use that countermeasure; how the different kinds of aggro work, and when you need to manipulate them; the timers (which aren't made visible), and how to optimise your play around them.</p>

                    <h2 id="review-title">Overview - Hearthstone</h2>
                    <p id="details">Hearthstone’s brilliance is that it doesn’t rely on complex, complicated rule interactions to create or sustain skilled play. With a few exceptions (looking at you, Crazed Alchemist), card effects are self-explanatory and communicate their effects with just a few words. Fireball deals six damage. Assassinate destroys a minion. Chillwind Yeti is a fantastic mid-game minion with 4 attack and 5 health. Its accessibility is enticing: simply play minion and spell cards until your opponent’s health is depleted.<br><br>Splitting the card pool among nine playable classes, each with their own unique special power, add to this feeling. Each Hearthstone class thematically echoes their World of Warcraft counterpart and a TCG archetype - Warlocks can damage themselves to draw a card, favoring an aggressive playstyle, Priests can heal and favor defense, Mages deal direct damage, and so on. This system smartly (and gently) nudges new players closer to standard deck construction, while still providing plenty of variety and flexibility for experts. This also serves as a great connection to Warcraft lore.</p>
