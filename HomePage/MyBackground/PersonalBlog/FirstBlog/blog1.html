                <p>Life is not always great.</p>
                <p>At times it may not even feel OK.</p>
                <p>When you’ve had several setbacks in a row, bad luck or things aren’t going your way – even though you do your best – then it may feel like: my life simply and honestly sucks.</p>
                <p>I think most of us have had days and likely longer periods like weeks or months when we’ve thought about life like this and felt pretty glum and like there’s a <a href="http://premium.positivityblog.com/self-esteem-course/">personal little rain cloud over your head</a>.</p>
                <p>What can you do when that happens?</p>
                <p>In this article I’d like to share 10 things that have helped me when I’ve asked myself: why does my life suck?</p>
                <p>I hope you find something here that’ll help you out.</p>
                <p style="font-style:normal"><strong>1. It’s OK to feel frustrated (but know how to handle it so you don’t get stuck).</strong></p>
                <p>When things aren’t going your way then you sometimes get frustrated. That’s natural and OK. So instead of trying to push these emotions away accept and process them.</p>
                <p>But also know how to not get stuck in them because then they’ll just suck a lot of energy and time from your week.</p>
                <p>One thing that helps me to reduce that frustration so I can move forward once again is to stop my thoughts from bouncing around in the past or a possible future by reconnecting with this moment.</p>
                <p>Two of my favorite ways for doing that are to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus on my breathing.</strong> I sit down with closed eyes and then just focus on the air going in and out of my nose. I do that for 1-2 minutes while making sure that I take calm and slightly deep breathes than I usually do and I breathe with my belly (and not my chest).</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on what is around me for 1-2 minutes.</strong> The people going by out on the street. The slight draft from one of the windows. The warmth from the radiator. The snow slowly falling outside my window and the soft clothes on my skin. This brings my attention fully back to what is here right now.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By doing one of these things for just that tiny amount of time I calm down and it becomes easier to focus and to think clearly again.</p>
                <p>I then follow that up with the next habit in this article…</p>
                <p style="font-style:normal"><strong>2. Tap into gratitude for the simplest of things.</strong></p>
                <p>This is usually my next step when I want to reduce frustration. But it works well on its own too when you feel like life sucks.</p>
                <p>Because during those times it’s easy to go from feeling sorry for yourself for a while into full on victim thinking that lasts for too long and drags you down.</p>
                <p>I find that zooming out a bit during these times helps.</p>
                <p>So I ask myself: what are 3 simple things that I can still be grateful for having in my life?</p>
                <p>A handful of answers that I tend to come back to often are at least partly things that are basic for me but many out there in the world still don’t have access to. Like for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A roof over my head and a warm home.</li>
                    <li>Plenty of drinkable water.</li>
                    <li>I don’t have to go hungry.</li>
                    <li>The simple pleasures of life like a sunset or a relaxing walk in the woods.</li>
                    <li>My family and friends.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-style:normal"><strong>3. Focus more on the small how-tos and less on the whys.</strong></p>
                <p>Processing what happened and what you feel is certainly important. But instead of taking the common route of dwelling on the whys of the negative situation 80% of the time and looking for solutions 20% of the time switch those numbers around.</p>
                <p>Spend more of your time on finding the small and practical steps you can take to make things better (even if it’s just a little better at this time).</p>
                <p>By doing so you’ll start to feel more confident and less suffocated and paralyzed as you are moving forward once again.</p>
                <p style="font-style:normal"><strong>4. Reminder: This is temporary. And there is a brand new day tomorrow.</strong></p>
                <p>Just because this day or the last week didn’t go well doesn’t mean that there is not a brand new day tomorrow.</p>
                <p>A day when you can start anew.</p>
                <p>With taking action to move towards what you want, likely having a bit more luck and when it will be easier to see that this difficult time is only temporary and not permanent (even if it might feel that way right now).</p>
                <p style="font-style:normal"><strong>5. Ask yourself: What is going well in my life though?</strong></p>
                <p>It is very easy to get stuck in focusing on the negative things when you start thinking that life or your week or month isn’t going well.</p>
                <p>But don’t forget that there are still things that are going well in your life. It may be small things.</p>
                <p>When I had several setbacks last year I asked myself this question and it helped me to open up my mind and to not get too focused on only the things that weren’t going so well. By opening my mind I could see that many vital things like my small business, my exercise habit and flossing habit were indeed going well and that several fun things had happened recently too.</p>
